Python wrapper for Sportradar APIs

## DISCLAIMER
This Python package and its development team has no association with Sportradar. I pay for a license just like anyone else who wants to use their APIs. Therefore, Sportradar is fully within their rights to make changes to their APIs that break this package. I will do my best to fix any breaking changes that come along but I am one person with a day job. Please be patient.

## Introduction
This Python package serves as a wrapper around Sportradar APIs. It does not provide an API key, you will have to obtain a key from Sportradar which, depending on your use case, may cost money. You can get a key by signing up for a Sportradar account here: https://developer.sportradar.com/member/register.

## Requirements
- Python 3.12.1
- Sportradar API key

## Supported APIs
Sportsradar offers APIs for many sports, most of which I am unfamiliar with. Here are the APIs this package supports:
| Sport | Status |
| ----- | ------ |
| NCAAMB | In Progress |
